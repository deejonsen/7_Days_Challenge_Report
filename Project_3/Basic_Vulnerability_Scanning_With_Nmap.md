### 🕵️‍♂️Day 3 Report

---

### **Network Traffic Monitoring & Packet Analysis**

### **Objective: Discover open ports and potential vulnerabilities on a system.**

---
### **Introduction**
Wireshark is an advanced tool used to capture and analyze network traffic in real time. It provides a comprehensive view of what’s happening on the network, which is invaluable for cybersecurity professionals, network administrators, and analysts. One of Wireshark's most powerful features is its ability to apply **display filters**. Display filters allow users to isolate and examine specific types of network traffic, making the task of identifying potential security threats much easier.

## **📜Tasks Completed**

### **1️⃣ Installed Wireshark**
✔️ **Linux/Ubuntu:**
```
sudo apt install wireshark -y  # Installed Wireshark via terminal
```
🔹 **✅Kali Linux:**

✔️ Wireshark is pre-installed. Launched with:
```
wireshark
```


### **2️⃣ Captured Network Traffic**
**✔️ Steps Taken:**
- **Selected an active network interface (e.g., `eth0` or `wlan0`).**
- **Started capturing live traffic.**
- **Applied filters to isolate specific protocols:**
```
http  # Filter HTTP traffic (websites, unencrypted logins)
dns   # Filter DNS queries (domain lookups)
icmp  # Filter ICMP packets (ping requests)
```


### **3️⃣ Analyzed a PCAP File**
**✔️ Sample PCAP File:**
**Downloaded **PCAP file** from** [https://wiki.wireshark.org/uploads/27707187aeb30df68e70c8fb9d614981/http.cap)).

**🎯 Key Findings:**
  - **Plaintext Credentials:**
    - **Found HTTP traffic with unencrypted username/password fields.**
    - **Example packet: POST /login HTTP/1.1 → username=admin&password=12345.**
  
  - **💡Protocol Risks:**
    - **Highlighted insecure protocols like **HTTP, FTP, & Telnet**  transmitting data unencrypted.**


### **4️⃣ Identified Suspicious Activity**
**🚨 Red Flags:**

  - **Large Data Transfers:**
    - **Filtered for **`tcp.len > 1000`** to detect large payloads (e.g., file exfiltration).**

  - **Failed Logins:**
    - **Searched for repeated **`HTTP 401 Unauthorized`** or **`SSH Failed password alerts`**.**
   
  - **Unknown IPs:**
    - **Used **`ip.addr == 192.168.1.100`** to track unrecognized IPs communicating with the host.
  

### **🚀Key Takeaways**
- **Wireshark Filters are critical for efficient analysis (e.g., `http.request.method == "POST`").**
- **Plaintext protocols (HTTP, FTP) expose sensitive data to eavesdroppers.**
- **Unusual traffic patterns (e.g., spikes in ICMP requests) may indicate reconnaissance or attacks.**
